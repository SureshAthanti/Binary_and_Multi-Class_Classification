# Binary Classification and Multi-Class Classification

## Details about Dataset
We have used two different datasets for the implementation
1. Income-Classification: https://www.kaggle.com/lodetomasi1995/income-classification
2. human activity recognition with smartphones: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/human-activity-recognition-with-smartphones

- The implementation was done using Pipeline, ColumnTransformer and OneHotEncoder to fit.
- Different algorithms with parameter tuning (RandomizedSearchCVand GridSearchCV) and cross-validation to classify the "price".
